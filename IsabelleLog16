Dr. Sarah Kennedy’s Observation Log
Observation Log: Subject: Isabelle (Gorilla), Experiment Code: INV-013

Overview:

This log documents the reversal process of Isabelle’s invisibility using the reversion serum (RS-001). The procedure aims to restore visible light refraction while monitoring for physiological or behavioral changes. Isabelle’s response to the reversion process will serve as a critical benchmark for future applications of this technology.
Procedure Timeline:

5:30 PM – Preparation

    Isabelle was sedated with a mild anesthetic to ensure her safety during the serum administration.
    Vitals prior to administration:
        Heart Rate: 68 bpm
        Respiratory Rate: 12 breaths per minute
        Body Temperature: 37.5°C

5:45 PM – Serum Administration

    20 mL of RS-001 administered intravenously via the cephalic vein.
    Isabelle’s vitals were continuously monitored using telemetry.

5:50 PM – Initial Reaction

    Within five minutes, Isabelle’s invisibility began to diminish, starting at the extremities (fingers and toes).
    Light refraction returned progressively, with pigmentation and surface details becoming visible in a wave-like pattern across her body.
    Heart rate briefly spiked to 90 bpm but stabilized within three minutes.

5:55 PM – Full Visibility Restored

    Complete restoration of visibility occurred within 10 minutes.
    Isabelle showed no immediate signs of distress upon waking from sedation.

Post-Reversion Examination:

Physical Appearance:

    Fur, skin, and facial features returned to their pre-invisibility state with no apparent abnormalities.
    Minor hair shedding was noted, consistent with prior observations during grooming activities.
    Eye pigmentation (dark brown) and sclera integrity remained normal.

Vital Signs:

    Heart Rate: 70 bpm
    Respiratory Rate: 13 breaths per minute
    Body Temperature: 37.6°C

Behavioral Observations:

    Upon waking, Isabelle appeared disoriented for approximately five minutes, emitting soft vocalizations and pacing within her enclosure.
    She regained composure and began engaging in normal behaviors, including grooming and interacting with enrichment objects.
    Notably, Isabelle displayed visible relief when examining her own body, frequently touching and grooming her limbs as if reacquainting herself with their visibility.

Neurological Function:

    Reflexes remained intact, with no signs of impaired coordination or cognitive function.
    Isabelle successfully navigated a familiar obstacle course, demonstrating spatial awareness and confidence.

Laboratory Results:

Blood Analysis (Pre- and Post-Reversion):

    Hemoglobin levels remained within normal ranges.
    Serum electrolyte levels showed minor fluctuations, likely attributable to stress, but no lasting imbalances were detected.

Skin and Hair Samples:

    Microscopic analysis confirmed the complete restoration of light-reflecting properties in fur and epidermis. No structural anomalies were found.

Health Recommendations:

    Observation Period: Maintain hourly monitoring of vitals for the next 48 hours to rule out delayed side effects.
    Behavioral Enrichment: Provide comforting objects and familiar routines to reduce any residual stress from the procedure.
    Nutritional Support: Offer a high-energy meal to replenish any resources expended during the reversion process.
    Neurological Monitoring: Conduct follow-up assessments to ensure long-term cognitive and motor function integrity.

Personal Notes:

Watching Isabelle’s form gradually reappear was nothing short of extraordinary. She handled the reversal process remarkably well, with minimal signs of distress. The moment she began touching her arms, visibly relieved to see them again, was a powerful reminder of her sentience and emotional depth.

Despite the scientific success, this procedure underscores the ethical complexity of these experiments. Isabelle’s well-being remains our top priority as we prepare for further trials.
