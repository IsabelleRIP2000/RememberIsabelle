Dr. Sarah Kennedy’s Observation Log
Observation Log: Subject: Isabelle (Gorilla)
Experiment Code: INV-018

Overview:

This log details Isabelle’s post-injection recovery after receiving the experimental visibility-reversing serum. While the serum successfully restored her visibility, the procedure induced cardiac arrest approximately 2 minutes after administration. Emergency intervention, including defibrillation, was required to stabilize her. The incident highlights the serum’s potential risks and underscores the importance of further refinement before additional applications.
Physical Health Observations:

Vital Signs:

    Heart rate spiked to 120 bpm within 30 seconds of injection, followed by rapid fluctuations. Cardiac arrest occurred approximately 2 minutes post-administration, confirmed by a flatline on monitoring equipment.
    Emergency defibrillation restored cardiac activity after two shocks, with heart rate stabilizing at 95 bpm initially and normalizing to 82 bpm within 12 hours.
    Respiration ceased briefly during cardiac arrest but resumed upon resuscitation. Breathing stabilized at 16 breaths per minute 30 minutes post-intervention.
    Core body temperature increased to 38.5°C after injection, dropping to 37.3°C over the following 8 hours.

Nutritional Intake:

    Appetite suppressed for 6 hours post-injection. Isabelle consumed smaller-than-usual portions but returned to normal feeding behavior within 24 hours.
    Hydration levels remained consistent, with normal water intake observed.

Neurological Function:

    Reflexes were initially exaggerated post-injection, with hypersensitivity to tactile and auditory stimuli. These effects subsided within 6 hours.
    Minor motor tremors observed during the first 2 hours post-revival resolved without intervention.

Integumentary System:

    Full visibility of skin and hair restored. Temporary patchy discoloration (reddish hue) across arms and chest resolved within 48 hours. Minor skin flaking in affected areas was observed but appears superficial and healing.

Cardiovascular Monitoring:

    Blood pressure rose sharply to 190/110 mmHg before cardiac arrest, stabilizing at 150/88 mmHg post-revival. Continued trending downward to pre-injection baselines within 24 hours.

Behavioral and Psychological Health:

Emotional Responses:

    Isabelle displayed severe agitation immediately post-revival, including pacing, vocalizing, and briefly striking at enclosure barriers.
    Caregiver interaction reduced agitation slightly, though heightened stress persisted for several hours.

Cognitive Adjustment:

    Upon regaining visibility, Isabelle appeared confused and hesitant, pausing frequently to examine her hands and arms. This behavior subsided within 4 hours as she readjusted to her restored physical form.

Stress Indicators:

    Increased pacing and vocalizations indicate lingering distress. Self-directed behaviors such as scratching suggest mild discomfort or residual agitation but do not appear harmful.

Complications:

    Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation:
        Isabelle experienced cardiac arrest approximately 2 minutes after serum injection, necessitating emergency defibrillation. Two shocks successfully restored cardiac function, but the incident underscores the serum’s acute risks.

    Localized Skin Reaction:
        Temporary discoloration and minor skin flaking in specific areas suggest inflammatory effects of the serum. These resolved spontaneously but warrant further study.

    Neurological Sensitivity:
        Hypersensitivity to stimuli and minor tremors indicate transient nervous system hyperactivity caused by the serum.

    Behavioral Agitation:
        Elevated vocalizations and pacing, along with self-directed behaviors, suggest ongoing psychological distress, possibly linked to the traumatic reversal process.

Health Recommendations:

    Immediate Care:
        Maintain a low-stimulation environment to mitigate stress and overstimulation.
        Closely monitor vital signs, particularly cardiac and neurological markers, for the next 72 hours.

    Long-Term Monitoring:
        Weekly follow-ups to assess cardiovascular recovery and skin health.
        Behavioral assessments to track agitation levels and ensure gradual psychological recovery.

    Serum Refinement:
        Investigate triggers for the cardiac arrest and identify adjustments to reduce its likelihood.
        Explore slower or incremental administration methods to minimize acute physiological responses.

Personal Notes:

Isabelle’s recovery following this procedure demonstrates her resilience, but the cardiac arrest highlights the serious risks associated with the reversing serum. While the serum’s success in restoring visibility is a significant achievement, the process has proven to be traumatic and potentially life-threatening.

Moving forward, we must prioritize Isabelle’s physical and psychological recovery while refining the serum to prevent similar complications. Her well-being remains the highest priority as we continue to navigate the challenges of this experimental process.
