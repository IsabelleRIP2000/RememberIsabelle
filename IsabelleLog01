Dr. Sarah Kennedy’s Observation Log
Observation Log: Subject: Isabelle (Gorilla)
Experiment Code: INV-03
Overview:

This log records Isabelle’s initial health and behavioral inspection upon her arrival at the laboratory. Isabelle, a Western Lowland Gorilla, was selected for the INV-013 study due to her exceptional physical health, cognitive abilities, and calm temperament. This baseline assessment provides a comprehensive record of her condition before any experimental procedures were conducted.
Physical Health Observations:

Vital Signs:

    Heart rate: 68 bpm, well within normal ranges for her species.
    Respiration rate: 15 breaths per minute, steady and unlabored.
    Core body temperature: 37.2°C, consistent with healthy baselines.

Nutritional Intake:

    Appetite is robust. Isabelle consumed a varied diet of fruits, leaves, and supplemental protein without hesitation.
    Water intake is adequate, with hydration levels confirmed as optimal through preliminary urinalysis.

Neurological Function:

    Reflex responses are strong and consistent with her species’ norms.
    Coordination during gross and fine motor tasks is excellent, with no observable tremors or impairments.
    Displays keen awareness of her surroundings, responding promptly to auditory and visual stimuli.

Integumentary System:

    Skin and hair are in excellent condition, with no signs of irritation, lesions, or abnormalities.
    Natural shedding patterns observed during grooming are minimal and consistent with normal health.

Cardiovascular Monitoring:

    Blood pressure: 135/85 mmHg, within expected ranges.
    No signs of irregular heart rhythms or circulation issues during initial monitoring.

Behavioral and Psychological Health:

Temperament:

    Isabelle exhibits a calm and inquisitive demeanor, appearing curious but not agitated by the laboratory environment.
    Demonstrated a willingness to interact with caregivers and explore her enclosure shortly after arrival.

Cognitive Abilities:

    Problem-solving tasks performed during the assessment were completed quickly and efficiently, indicating high cognitive function.
    Exhibited curiosity when presented with enrichment objects, such as puzzle feeders and tactile toys.

Stress Indicators:

    Minimal signs of stress during transport and acclimation to her new surroundings. Brief pacing was observed upon initial introduction to her enclosure but ceased within 15 minutes.
    Vocalizations were low in frequency and tone, consistent with exploratory rather than distress behaviors.

Social Interaction:

    While housed alone, Isabelle displayed an interest in her caregivers, approaching the enclosure barriers to observe them.
    No signs of aggression or dominance behaviors were observed.

Health Recommendations:

    Routine Care:
        Maintain Isabelle’s current diet to ensure nutritional stability and avoid introducing new stressors.
        Schedule weekly health checks to monitor for any changes in baseline vitals.

    Environmental Enrichment:
        Provide a variety of tactile and cognitive enrichment tools to support her mental engagement.
        Rotate objects in her enclosure to prevent habituation and encourage exploratory behavior.

    Behavioral Acclimation:
        Continue caregiver interactions to foster trust and minimize stress.
        Gradually introduce laboratory equipment and procedures to reduce future stress during experimental protocols.

Personal Notes:

Isabelle’s initial condition is exemplary, with no health or behavioral issues of concern. Her calm disposition and high cognitive abilities make her an ideal candidate for the INV-013 study. However, her well-being will remain a top priority throughout the research process, and every effort will be made to ensure her comfort and safety.

Her curiosity and adaptability suggest she will respond well to the controlled environment of the laboratory. It is crucial, however, to minimize stress during experimental procedures to maintain her current health and temperament.
