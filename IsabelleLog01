Dr. Sarah Kennedy’s Observation Log
Observation Log: Subject: Isabelle (Gorilla)
Experiment Code: INV-01-A

Overview:

This entry documents the routine physical and behavioral examination of Isabelle, a recently acquired Western Lowland Gorilla. The purpose of this examination is to establish baseline health metrics and assess her suitability for future non-invasive scientific studies.

Subject Details:

    Name: Isabelle
    Species: Gorilla gorilla gorilla (Western Lowland Gorilla)
    Sex: Female
    Age: Estimated 8 years
    Weight: 85 kg

Physical Examination:

Vital Signs:

    Heart Rate: 65 bpm (within normal range for a calm adult female).
    Respiratory Rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal).
    Body Temperature: 37.6°C (normal range).

General Appearance:

    Isabelle appears well-nourished with no signs of malnutrition or dehydration.
    Coat is glossy and well-maintained, indicative of good health and regular grooming habits.

Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat:

    Eyes are clear and responsive to light. No signs of infection or irritation.
    Ears are clean, with no detectable discharge or inflammation.
    Nasal passages are clear, and no abnormalities are noted in throat inspection.

Teeth and Oral Cavity:

    Teeth show minor wear consistent with age and diet.
    No visible signs of dental disease or oral infection.

Musculoskeletal System:

    Isabelle demonstrates excellent muscle tone and coordination.
    No signs of lameness or joint stiffness during mobility testing.

Integumentary System:

    Skin is healthy, with no lesions, infections, or abnormal growths.
    Minor scars noted on left forearm, likely from previous social interactions within her troop.

Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems:

    Auscultation reveals no murmurs or abnormalities in heart rhythm.
    Lungs are clear, with no audible wheezes or crackles.

Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary Systems:

    Abdomen palpation reveals no tenderness or abnormalities.
    Urine and fecal samples were collected for analysis; visual inspection indicates normal output and consistency.

Behavioral Assessment:

General Demeanor:

    Isabelle appears calm but slightly reserved, typical of a recently relocated individual.
    Displays curiosity, periodically observing staff movements and reaching out for nearby objects.

Social Behavior:

    During a brief introduction to her enclosure, Isabelle showed no signs of aggression.
    She vocalized softly and engaged in exploratory behaviors, such as sniffing and manipulating enrichment items.

Cognitive Observations:

    Demonstrated problem-solving skills when presented with a simple puzzle feeder.
    Expressed frustration when unable to retrieve food immediately but persisted until successful.

Laboratory Tests:

Samples collected (blood, urine, feces) are pending analysis. Initial results will focus on identifying potential deficiencies, infections, or other conditions requiring treatment.
Recommendations:

    Acclimation Period: Allow Isabelle several days to adjust to her new environment before introducing complex stimuli or studies.
    Dietary Plan: Maintain her current diet with gradual adjustments to align with laboratory standards, emphasizing fresh produce, high-fiber foods, and protein supplements.
    Enrichment: Continue providing mental stimulation through puzzles and tactile objects to promote cognitive engagement and reduce stress.
    Monitoring: Conduct daily behavioral observations for signs of stress or health decline during the acclimation period.

Personal Notes:

Isabelle is a remarkable specimen, exhibiting intelligence and a calm temperament despite the stress of relocation. While she is physically robust, the emotional toll of separation from her previous environment cannot be ignored. Establishing trust with her and maintaining a consistent routine will be critical for her well-being and the success of any future studies.
