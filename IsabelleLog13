Dr. Sarah Kennedy’s Observation Log
Observation Log: Subject: Isabelle (Gorilla), Experiment Code: INV-013

Overview:

This log focuses on the physiological and psychological health of Isabelle, a Western Lowland Gorilla, following the administration of the experimental invisibility serum. Observations aim to identify immediate effects and potential long-term health risks associated with the procedure.
Physical Health Observations:

Vital Signs:

    Heart rate slightly elevated at 72 bpm, consistent with mild stress but within acceptable limits for her species.
    Respiration rate stable at 16 breaths per minute.
    Core body temperature recorded at 37.2°C, which aligns with pre-procedure baselines.

Nutritional Intake:

    Isabelle consumed her usual diet (fruit, leaves, and supplemental protein) with minor coordination issues noted during hand-to-mouth movements. These challenges appear to stem from the lack of visual feedback, as she often paused to locate her invisible hands.
    Water intake was normal, and hydration levels remain consistent.

Neurological Function:

    Reflex tests show no signs of impairment. Isabelle responded appropriately to auditory, tactile, and olfactory stimuli.
    Motor coordination remains unaffected aside from occasional pauses during fine motor tasks.

Integumentary System:

    Microscopic examination confirms intact skin and hair follicles, despite their invisibility. No signs of irritation, lesions, or other abnormalities are present.
    Minor shedding of hair observed during grooming activities, consistent with natural patterns.

Cardiovascular Monitoring:

    Blood pressure slightly elevated, likely due to stress, but no irregularities were detected in cardiac rhythms or oxygen saturation.

Behavioral and Psychological Health:

Emotional Responses:

    Isabelle exhibits periods of agitation, including pacing and low-frequency vocalizations, particularly during solitary confinement.
    When introduced to familiar caregivers, she showed reduced signs of stress, engaging in subdued grooming behaviors and gentle hand gestures.

Cognitive Adjustment:

    Adaptation to invisibility is progressing steadily. Isabelle has begun relying more on tactile and auditory cues, such as tapping objects to gauge their location.
    She demonstrated increased curiosity when presented with reflective surfaces, using her invisible hands to trace her reflection.

Stress Indicators:

    Initial signs of distress included prolonged vocalizations and self-directed grooming. These behaviors diminished over time but warrant continued monitoring.
    Isabelle appears most stressed when attempting tasks requiring visual confirmation of her body, such as grasping objects or grooming.

Social Interaction:

    When paired with another gorilla from her troop (a visible control subject), Isabelle showed typical dominance behaviors, including chest beating and mock charging, but no signs of aggression.
    Her troopmate displayed confusion initially but resumed normal interaction within 30 minutes.

Health Recommendations:

    Nutritional Support: Introduce high-contrast feeding tools or containers to assist Isabelle with hand-to-mouth coordination during meals.
    Environmental Modifications: Implement tactile markers and non-visual cues (e.g., textured flooring or ultrasonic pings) to improve spatial orientation.
    Physical Contact: Provide regular caregiver interaction to alleviate stress and reinforce her sense of security.
    Behavioral Monitoring: Continue observing troop dynamics to ensure her invisibility does not disrupt social hierarchy or create conflict.
    Long-term Testing: Schedule bi-weekly full health assessments to monitor for delayed effects, particularly on cardiovascular health or skin integrity.

Personal Notes:

Isabelle’s resilience to this groundbreaking procedure is a testament to her intelligence and adaptability. However, the psychological burden of invisibility is apparent, particularly in tasks requiring visual confirmation of self. While she remains physically healthy, her elevated stress levels highlight the ethical challenges of such experiments.

Moving forward, we must prioritize her mental well-being alongside her physical health, ensuring her experience remains as comfortable and enriching as possible under these extraordinary circumstances.
