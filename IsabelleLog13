Dr. Sarah Kennedy’s Observation Log
Observation Log: Subject: Isabelle (Gorilla)
Experiment Code: INV-013-B
Overview:

This log details the physiological and psychological health of Isabelle, a Western Lowland Gorilla, following her third observation period after the administration of the experimental invisibility serum. Isabelle remains physically healthy, though subtle signs of increased agitation have been observed. These behaviors suggest a need for continued monitoring and environmental adjustments to support her adaptation.
Physical Health Observations:

Vital Signs:

    Heart rate recorded at 75 bpm, a slight increase from the previous baseline but within acceptable limits.
    Respiration rate steady at 16 breaths per minute.
    Core body temperature stable at 37.3°C, consistent with her pre-procedure values.

Nutritional Intake:

    Isabelle consumed her standard diet without significant difficulty. Slight delays during feeding, likely due to the challenges of locating her invisible hands, were observed but did not impact overall intake.
    Water consumption remains consistent, and hydration levels are normal.

Neurological Function:

    Reflexes remain intact, with appropriate responses to auditory and tactile stimuli.
    Coordination during gross motor tasks is unaffected, though occasional hesitations during fine motor tasks suggest minor frustration.

Integumentary System:

    Examination via infrared imaging confirms intact skin and underlying structures. No abnormalities, irritation, or lesions were detected.

Cardiovascular Monitoring:

    Blood pressure marginally elevated at 145/88 mmHg, likely linked to increased stress levels, but no irregularities in cardiac rhythm or oxygen saturation were noted.

Behavioral and Psychological Health:

Emotional Responses:

    Isabelle exhibits intermittent pacing and low-frequency vocalizations, consistent with mild agitation. These behaviors are most pronounced during periods of isolation.
    Caregiver interaction continues to provide a calming effect, with noticeable reductions in pacing and vocalizations during these sessions.

Cognitive Adjustment:

    Isabelle is adapting to her invisibility by increasingly relying on auditory and tactile cues. For example, she has been observed gently tapping surfaces before engaging with them, likely to confirm their location.

Stress Indicators:

    Subtle signs of stress, such as prolonged vocalizations and occasional pauses in activity, have been noted but do not suggest acute distress.

Health Recommendations:

    Environmental Modifications:
        Introduce objects with distinct auditory feedback (e.g., bells or hollow objects) to assist Isabelle in navigating her environment.
        Continue the use of tactile markers and textured surfaces to improve spatial orientation.

    Behavioral Support:
        Increase caregiver interaction time to reinforce trust and reduce stress levels.
        Provide structured enrichment activities that engage her auditory and tactile senses, promoting positive engagement with her environment.

    Monitoring and Assessment:
        Maintain bi-weekly health assessments to monitor cardiovascular and psychological markers.
        Document behavioral changes carefully to assess long-term adaptation trends.

Personal Notes:

Isabelle continues to display remarkable resilience to the serum’s effects, with her physical health remaining stable. Her increased reliance on non-visual cues demonstrates her capacity to adapt, though the subtle rise in stress-related behaviors warrants ongoing attention.

While her agitation levels are slightly elevated, they remain manageable and do not pose a concern at this stage. Moving forward, we must prioritize enrichment activities and caregiver interaction to ensure Isabelle's adaptation remains on a positive trajectory.
